Situated in the picturesque countryside of Earling Iowa is a Franciscan convent. The warm breeze of a bright summer day in 1928 is in stark contrast to the dark soul-stirring phenomenon occurring just beyond the convent walls. Inside, a disturbed woman displays such bone-chilling behaviors that the nuns caring for her are left terrified.

This case quickly became a national sensation, and the attending Father emerges as America's most famous exorcist to date. The pseudonym Anna Ecklund was given in an attempt at anonymity, but by the time the exorcism was over, most of the country already knew who she was. This is the possession of Emma Schmidt.
