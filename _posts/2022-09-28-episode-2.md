Some movies leave a lasting impression on its viewers, and the Exorcist, released in 1973, was no exception. But it wasn’t just the vile and shocking nature of the scenes that made this movie so historic. It was the fact that the tormented young girl depicted in the movie was based on an actual person. With Hollywood having turned this tale into a cult classic, most assume that the movie is far worse than what could have transpired in real life. However, this couldn’t be farther from the truth. The real life case had chilling claims of supernatural phenomena, malevolent spirits, and witnesses to corroborate it all. One final plot twist? Unlike in the movie, it wasn’t a girl who had these experiences, but a boy. This is the possession of Ronald Hunkeler.
