*Warning: this episode contains graphic and violent content.*
In the early morning hours of October 6th, 1974, a chill was felt in the air of Ossett a small, sleepy town in Yorkshire, England, but it wasn't because it was a cool, crisp fall day. It was because an unspeakable act had just occurred. A devoted wife and loving mother to five children was violently murdered alongside the family dog in her home.

The manner in which she was killed was so evil, it left the town in a state of shock and terror. The killer was quickly identified and detained in a psychiatric hospital to await trial. Who was the killer? None other than her husband and his defense: you guessed it. This is the possession of Michael Taylor.
