Christmas in 1700 England was a true site to behold. Bows of holly and ivy wrapped around street lamps and entryways, aroma of mid-winter feast, including jolly cakes. Roasted duck and rich gravies filled the air while the distance sound of carers could be heard at every turn. Performers in lavish costumes would take to the streets to celebrate the birth of their Lord and Savior.

This is the possession of George Lukins.
