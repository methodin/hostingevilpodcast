During the summer of 1980, a young Connecticut couple moved into a rented home to start a new life together, but their presence unknowingly releases a demon that will haunt not only them, but their loved ones. Initially, the demon possesses a young boy in the family before turning on the young man who attempts to challenge it.

Even with the help of famous demonographers Ed and Lorraine Warren, a murder and trial will soon follow. This salacious story would even develop into a motion picture. This is the possession of a Arne Cheyenne Johnson.
