On July 1, 1976 a 23 year old woman died in her family home. Riddled with facial wounds, broken teeth and weighing only 68 pounds, the official cause of death as stated in her autopsy report was malnutrition and dehydration. However, many believed, as did the woman when she was alive, that something more sinister was at play. The facts surrounding this case: extreme religion, bizarre behavior, an ominous death, and a criminal trial would thrust the world of demonic possession into the spotlight so much so that many years later the movie "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" would be based on the real life ordeal. This is the possession of Anneliese Michel.
