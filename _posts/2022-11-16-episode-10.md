On October 3rd, 1869, a young boy was exercised at a chapel in the orphanage where he resided. However, he wasn't your typical orphan as he had a family who loved him, but could no longer care for him after they claimed he became possessed by the devil.  His behaviors, including twisting his limbs in various directions and violent outbursts, was the catalyst for the family to relinquish him while he awaited exorcism.

But one of the most striking things about this case is that it wasn't just one child from this family who was under spiritual attack and sent to an orphanage. It was two. This is the possession of the Burner Brothers Theobald & Joseph.
