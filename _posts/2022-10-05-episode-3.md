In 1978, Warren Zevon released the song Werewolves of London that included the lyrics: "You hear him howling around your kitchen door, you better not let him in, little old lady got mutilated last night, werewolves of London again." The song was inspired by the 1935 movie of the same name. Little did anyone know that the popular hit song would be released just as a small town in London was in the midst of dealing with its very own real life werewolf and things were coming to a head. This is the possession of Bill Ramsey, the Southend werewolf of London.
