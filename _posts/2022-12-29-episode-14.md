In 2014, Zak Bagans, host of Discovery Channels, Ghost Adventures, purchased a small one-story home in Gary, Indiana. So that he could make a documentary. The lore came from when the house made national attention as being dubbed the "Portal to Hell" when its tenants, years prior, claimed demons were taking up residence alongside them.

Some believe the story was fabricated while others, including a 37-year veteran of the Gary Police Department, believed it. The events that unfolded led to one of the most unusual cases that Department of Children's Services had ever handled, but this story ends with Zak's documentary.

It begins with a single mother and her three children. This is the possession of the Ammons family.
