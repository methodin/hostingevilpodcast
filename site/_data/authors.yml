  bio: "I've been interested in the paranormal and how religion plays a part in that for as far back as I can recall. When podcasts emerged, I was excited to have a ton of content about any subject at my fingertips. Working in the religious field I realized that demonic possession wasn't something I was hearing about on podcasts so I immediately began researching and put a plan into place to make it happen. When I'm not podcasting, I'm either going to concerts, hiking or kayaking in the mountains or obsessing over my Persian cats, my favorite band and my family."

  bio: "I have always enjoyed learning about the unexplainable: mythical creatures, cryptology, ghosts, monsters, you name it. Growing up in the Roman Catholic faith, I was also interested in the duality between good and evil. As an adult, I spent my days for a religious organization and my nights researching and questioning how evil impacts our world and human nature. I am a researcher at heart and love to learn and now share these passions with others who are interested too. In my spare time I enjoy watching makeup tutorials and trying new looks, spending time with my two cats, looking for new tattoo ideas, or watching TV."
